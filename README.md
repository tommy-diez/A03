## ***This is a QnA/tutorial on git and gitHub***

## ***Q: First question... what is Git?***
###### A: GIT is a version control system developed by Linus Torvaldis that allows for more effective source code management.

## ***Q: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?***
###### A: Git is a local version control system. GitHub is a cloud based version control system with a user interface. 
It serves as a way to share code with others more effectively and allows for the repositories to be stored in a cloud.

## ***Q: But what is a repository?***
###### A: A repository is a data structure that stores project or sets of project files. A developer may use a repository to store his project files and give collaborative access to other developers or to their organization.

## ***Q: What is a commit?***
###### A: A commit is essentially a revision to a file or set of files. Every time a commit is made it creates an ID string called the SHA. This is to allow developers to keep a record of all the changes made to a project.

## ***Q: What does it mean to push?***
###### A: The push command allows you send changes in code to remote repositories. For example, if an organization has a repository on Github a developer may push their changes to it. 

## ***Q: What about pull?***
###### A: The pull command allows you to fetch new code from other remote files and merge them with your current work. 

## ***Q: What is a branch?*** 
###### A: A branch is essentially a lightweight pointer to a commit. This allows you to “branch out”, and make a new state of your current code, while keeping your current code unaffected. So you can theoretically work on a new features to your code without interacting with your main code directly since it is stored in a branch named master.

## ***Q: What is a merge?*** 
###### A: What a merge does is take changes made from one branch and apply them to another branch. This is the git command software engineers can use to merge changes made in their code with their main code. 

## ***Q: Now what is a merge conflict?***
###### A: A merge conflict occurs when a developer makes changes to the same line of a file. It can also happen if a developer  edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

## ***Q: What is the fetch command?***
###### A: This allows you to retrieve commits and files from a remote repository.

## ***Q: But what is a remote?***
###### A: A remote is a common repoistory stored in cloud based source code management systems such as gitHub and can be cloned locally.
